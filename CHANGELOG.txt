-- Initial Commit of the source provided by ShelterRin (thanks!)

I have included the two new language files from the latest alpha release with this commit.

Note that there are a few differences between the published V0.4.4 and the source I was provided, which I will document below.

EnchantmentAdept has some added debug text and some fixes.
Enchantmentadvancedmending has some added debug text and a pointer change.
EnchantmentAncient_CurseInflicter has an added null check.
EnchantmentEmpoweredDefence overrides canApply and always returns true if the item is a shield.
EnchantmentMastery has an added null check.
EnchantmentPandora has an added null check, has a slight tweak to its occurrence rate, has dark red text, and doesn't hide from players in creative. (NOTE this now imports EntityPlayerSP)
EnchantmentParry reduces its chances of proccing if True Strike is present. Also checks canBlockDamageSourceIgnoreUnblockable.
EnchantmentStrengthenedVitality has canApplyTogether return false with enchantments that implement IEnchantmentProtection or are/extend EnchantmentProtection
EnchantmentUtility has a new utility, canBlockDamageSourceIgnoreUnblockable, which is used by EnchantmentParry
